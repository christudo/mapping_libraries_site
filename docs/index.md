**INTRODUCTION:** <p>Libraries are not just repositories of books—they are symbols of memory, culture, and resistance. In Palestine, the destruction of libraries is not an isolated act of war; it represents a broader erasure of heritage. This project visualizes the destruction of Palestinian libraries alongside the lives lost on or around the same dates, creating a powerful data-driven narrative that links cultural annihilation with human tragedy.</p>

**RESEARCH QUESTION:** <p>How does the timeline of library destruction in Palestine align with documented casualties and the loss of people from the cultural sector, and what does this reveal about the broader targeting of cultural infrastructure?</p>
- The timeline of library destruction in Palestine reveals a profound alignment between the targeting of cultural infrastructure and the loss of human life. By comparing historical documentation from Librarians with Palestine (2013–2015) with more recent reports, including The Second Preliminary Report on the Cultural Sector Damage in Gaza (Oct 7–Dec 6, 2023), we observe that the destruction of libraries often coincides with high casualty counts, underscoring a pattern where attacks on knowledge institutions are not isolated but part of broader assaults on civilian and cultural life.</p>
- In multiple instances, libraries were destroyed on days when dozens or even hundreds of lives were lost, and among the dead were artists, writers, scholars, and archivists, people listed as “Martyrs of the Cultural Sector.” This convergence of structural and human erasure points to the obliteration of physical spaces of memory and the people who seek to celebrate and preserve it.</p> 
- This pattern reveals that the targeting of cultural infrastructure in Palestine is not collateral but systematic. The loss of libraries is inseparable from the loss of the people who breathe life into them. The visual narrative, supported by both scraped and manually curated data, reinforces that what is being erased is not only stone and paper, but legacy, lineage, and language.</p>
